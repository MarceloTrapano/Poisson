# Finite differential method and iteration methods for Poisson PDEs

This whole project is for solving second order Partial Differential Equations. Numerical methods used in this project include finite differential method, Jacobi iteration method, Gauss-Seidler iteration method, relaxation iterative mathod, Peaceman-Rachford iteration method and method that utilize adaptive grid. For more information about these methods repository includes raport in Polish.
